description: This page contains a list of default operations that are available as part of the package
---

The Dropl Package comes with a set of default operations that can be used to perform common tasks. These operations are available under the `Hibzz.Dropl.DefaultOperations` namespace.

The following operations are available:
**Move Operations**
- `MoveOperation`: Moves the given transform to the expected position over the given duration
- `MoveXOperation`: Moves the given transform to the expected position over the given duration, only on the X axis
- `MoveYOperation`: Moves the given transform to the expected position over the given duration, only on the Y axis
- `MoveZOperation`: Moves the given transform to the expected position over the given duration, only on the Z axis

**Translate Operations**
- `TranslateOperation`: Translates the given transform by the given offset over the given duration
- `TranslateXOperation`: Translates the given transform by the given offset over the given duration, only on the X axis
- `TranslateYOperation`: Translates the given transform by the given offset over the given duration, only on the Y axis
- `TranslateZOperation`: Translates the given transform by the given offset over the given duration, only on the Z axis

**Rotate Operations**
- `RotateOperation`: Rotates the given transform to the expected rotation (in Euler angles) over the given duration
- `RotateXOperation`: Rotates the given transform to the expected rotation over the given duration, only on the X axis
- `RotateYOperation`: Rotates the given transform to the expected rotation over the given duration, only on the Y axis
- `RotateZOperation`: Rotates the given transform to the expected rotation over the given duration, only on the Z axis

**Scale Operations**
- `ScaleOperation`: Scales the given transform to the expected scale over the given duration
- `ScaleXOperation`: Scales the given transform to the expected scale over the given duration, only on the X axis
- `ScaleYOperation`: Scales the given transform to the expected scale over the given duration, only on the Y axis
- `ScaleZOperation`: Scales the given transform to the expected scale over the given duration, only on the Z axis

**Sprite Operations**
- `SpriteFadeOperation`: Fades the given sprite to the expected alpha value over the given duration
- `SpriteTintOperation`: Tints the given sprite to the expected color over the given duration

**UI Image Operations**
- `UIFadeOperation`: Fades the given UI Image to the expected alpha value over the given duration
- `UITintOperation`: Tints the given UI Image to the expected color over the given duration
