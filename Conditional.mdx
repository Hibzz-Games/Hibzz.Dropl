The conditional class is an excellent utility script to check multiple custom conditions and return a value based on the result. It can be configured to check if any or all of the conditions are true or false.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the conditional class to check if all conditions are true:

```csharp
Conditional isHealthyAndInCombat = new Conditional(Conditional.RuleType.CHECK_ALL_ARE_TRUE);

// add custom conditions
isHealthyAndInCombat += () => player.Health > 50;
isHealthyAndInCombat += () => player.IsInCombat;

// perform the check
if(isHealthyAndInCombat())
{
    // add some logic here
}
```

In the above example, you can also see that conditionals can be dropped inside of an if statement to perform the check. This is because the implicit conversion to a boolean value is supported out of the box.

The conditional class can also be used to check if any of the conditions are true:

```csharp
Conditional isHealthyOrInCombat = new Conditional(Conditional.RuleType.CHECK_ANY_IS_TRUE);

// add custom conditions
isHealthyOrInCombat += () => player.Health > 50;
isHealthyOrInCombat += () => player.IsInCombat;

// perform the check
if(isHealthyOrInCombat())
{
    // add some logic here
}
```
