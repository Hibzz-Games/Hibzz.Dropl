A `Filter` is an object that defines the ruleset for filtering `Operation`s. It is mostly used in Dropl to select a subset of `Operation`s from a larger collection.

### Creating a Filter
To create a `Filter`, you need a new filter object and a set of rules. The rules can be defined in a number of ways:

```csharp
// Create a new filter
Filter filter = new Filter();

// An operation with the Target as "SomeGameObject" will be selected
filter.Target = SomeGameObject;

// An operation of the type HealthOperation will be selected
filter.Type = typeof(HealthOperation);

// An operation must fulfill the custom rule to be selected
// For example, this rule selects all operations with a health value of 10 or less
filter.CustomRule = (Operation operation) => {
    var healthOperation = operation as HealthOperation;
    if (healthOperation == null) {
        return false;
    }
    return healthOperation.Health <= 10;
};
```

An `Operation` must fulfill all of the rules to be selected by the `Filter`. A special case is when the `Filter` has no rules defined, in which case all `Operation`s will be selected.

# API Reference
## Properties
### `Object Target`
This property defines the existence of a rule that selects `Operation`s based on their `Target`. If this property is set, only `Operation`s with the same `Target` will be selected by the `Filter`.

### `Type OperationType`
This property defines the existence of a match rule that selects `Operation`s based on their type. If this property is set, only `Operation`s of the same type will be selected by the `Filter`.

### `Func<Operation, bool> CustomRule`
This property defines the existence of a custom user-defined rule that selects `Operation`s based on the result of the rule. An `Operation` is passed into the lambda function, and the function must return a `bool` value. When this function returns `true`, the `Operation` is selected by the `Filter`.

## Methods
### `bool DoesMatch(Operation operation)`
This method checks if the given `Operation` matches all the rules defined by the `Filter`. If the `Operation` matches all the rules, this method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
