The `Sequence` operation is a core `Operation` part of the Dropl package that allows the developers to string together multiple `Operation`s in a sequence. This is useful for creating a series of `Operation`s that need to be executed in a specific order.

## Usage
To create a new chain of `Operation`s, simply create a new `Sequence` object and start adding `Operation`s to it using the `Add` function. Once all of the `Operation`s have been added, the `Sequence` can be executed by adding it an `Executer` or by calling the `AddToDefaultExecuter` function.

```csharp
// Create a new Sequence
Sequence sequence = new Sequence();

// add Operations to the Sequence
sequence.Add(exampleOperation1);
sequence.Add(exampleOperation2);
sequence.Add(exampleOperation3);

// Add the Sequence to the default Executer
sequence.AddToDefaultExecuter();
```

When removing `Operation`s from an `Executer`, the base `Remove` function will not remove the `Operation`s nested inside of the `Sequence`. To remove the `Operation`s from deep inside of the `Sequence`, use the `RemoveAll` function.

# API Reference
## Methods
### `public void Add(Operation operation)`
Adds the given `Operation` to the `Sequence` at the end of the list so that it'll be executed later when all other `Operation`s in the queue have been dispersed.

### `public void Remove(Operation operation)`
Removes the given `Operation` from the `Sequence` if it exists. This function doesn't work recursively and if the `Operation` is nested inside of another `Sequence`, it won't be removed.

### `public void RemoveAll(Operation operation)`]
Removes all instances of the given `Operation` from the `Sequence`, including any instances that are nested inside of the child `Sequence`s.

### `public void Remove(Filter filter)`
Removes all `Operation`s from the `Sequence` that match the given `Filter`. This function doesn't work recursively and if the `Filter` matches an `Operation` that is nested inside of another `Sequence`, it won't be removed.

### `public void RemoveAll(Filter filter)`
Removes all `Operation`s from the `Sequence` that match the given `Filter`, including any instances that are nested inside of the child `Sequence`s.
