description: This page describes the functionality of the Easing class

The `Easing` class is used to define how a value changes over time as it scales from 0 to 1. It is used by the `Operation` class to define how to interpret the `progress` value on a scaled context.

There are two ways to define how an `Easing` definition behaves. The first is to use any of the built-in interpolation functions that are part of the Dropl Package. These are standard easing functions that are used in many animation libraries. The second is to define a custom `Easing` behavior using an `AnimationCurve` object.

```csharp
// Using a built-in easing function
Easing easing = new Easing(Interpolations.IN_SINE);

// or using an AnimationCurve
// assume that a serialized AnimationCurve is assigned to the variable curve
Easing easing = new Easing(curve);

// then the value can be evaluated using the Evaluate method
float value = easing.Evaluate(0.5f);

// and can be remapped to a different range
float remappedValue = easing.Evaluate(0.5f, -10, 10);
```

It's also important to note that both `Interpolations` and `AnimationCurve` objects can be passed directly to functions that accept an `Easing` object. This is because the `Easing` class has an implicit conversion operator for both of these types.

```csharp
void SomeFunction(Easing easing) { ... }

// Interpolations
SomeFunction(Interpolations.IN_SINE);

// AnimationCurve
SomeFunction(curve);
```

To learn more about these easing functions, check out the [easing functions](https://easings.net/) website. Although for internal use, have a look at the `Helpers` subclass in `Easing` to see how these functions are implemented and can be used outside of the Dropl Package.
