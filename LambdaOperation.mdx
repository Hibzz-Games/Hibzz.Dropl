The `LambdaOperation` is one of the core operations part of the Dropl Package. It allows the developers to execute any custom code as an operation without having to create a new class that inherits from the `Operation` class. This is useful for simple operations that are one-off and do not need to be reused.

## Usage
In essence, there are two types of `LambdaOperations`: a simple execute once type and an execute over time type. The execute over time type is self-explanatory and follows the general pattern and theme of the Dropl Package.

The need for the execute once type is more nuanced. By itself, it's kind of useless and a simple function call would suffice. However, when the operation must be delayed or must be executed as a part of a chain of operations using the `Sequence` operation, then this type of operation starts to make more sense.

### Execute Once
Here's an example of a simple execute once `LambdaOperation`:

```csharp
// heal the player after 5 seconds
var healPlayerOperation = new LambdaOperation(() => {
    playerHealth += 10;
});

// define the delay
healPlayerOperation.Delay = 5f;

// add the operation to the default executer
healPlayerOperation.AddToDefaultExecuter();
```

### Execute Over Time
Here's an example of a simple execution over time `LambdaOperation`:

```csharp
// heal the player over 5 seconds
float startHealth = playerHealth;
var healPlayerOperation = new LambdaOperation(duration: 5f, lambda: (float progress) => {
    playerHealth = startHealth + 10 * progress;
});

// add the operation to the default executer
healPlayerOperation.AddToDefaultExecuter();
```

Optionally, you can also specify the `Easing` method to use for the lambda operations in the constructor. If you do not specify an easing method, then the default easing method, Linear, will be used.

```csharp
// heal the player over 5 seconds using the EaseInCubic easing method
float startHealth = playerHealth;
var healPlayerOperation = new LambdaOperation(duration: 5f, easing: Easing.EaseInCubic, lambda: (float progress) => {
    playerHealth = startHealth + 10 * progress;
});

// add the operation to the default executer
healPlayerOperation.AddToDefaultExecuter();
```
